<p>The Brill Building is famous for housing music industry offices and studios where some of the most popular American music tunes of the 1940s to the 1960s were written. The songwriting team of Leiber and Stoller (Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller), for example, composed a surprising number of hits for early R&B singers, including the Elvis Presley hits 'Hound Dog', 'Jailhouse Rock', and 'Treat Me Nice'. Scores of music publishers had offices in the Brill Building. Songs produced in this building were constantly at the top of Billboard's Hit Parade and played by the leading bands of the day.</p>

<h4>Louis Armstrong House</h4>

<img src="https://jazzlives.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/louis-house-outside.jpeg">
<p>In 1943, Louis Armstrong and his wife, Lucille, settled in a modest house in Corona, Queens, where they lived for the remainder of their lives. No one has lived in the house since the Armstrongs, and the house and its furnishings remain very much as they were during Louis and Lucille’s lifetime. Today, the Louis Armstrong House Museum is open to the public, offering guided tours of Louis’s longtime home. On the tour, audio clips from Louis’s homemade recordings are played, and visitors hear Louis practicing his trumpet, enjoying a meal, or talking with his friends. Visitors also get to enjoy an exhibit on Louis’s life and legacy, and the Armstrongs’ beautiful Japanese-inspired garden.</p>
