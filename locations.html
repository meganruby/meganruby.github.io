<p>In 1943, Louis Armstrong and his wife, Lucille, settled in a modest house in Corona, Queens, where they lived for the remainder of their lives.

Today, the Louis Armstrong House Museum is open to the public, offering guided tours of Louis’s longtime home. On the tour, audio clips from Louis’s homemade recordings are played, and visitors hear Louis practicing his trumpet, enjoying a meal, or talking with his friends. Visitors also get to enjoy an exhibit on Louis’s life and legacy, and the Armstrongs’ beautiful Japanese-inspired garden.</p>

<p>1520 Sedgwick Avenue is a 102-unit apartment building in the Morris Heights neighborhood in the Bronx, New York City. In 2010, The New York Times reported that it is the accepted birthplace of hip hop.  Clive Campbell, later known as DJ Kool Herc, is credited with helping to start hip hop and rap music at a house concert in the building on August 11, 1973. At the concert he was DJing and emceeing in the recreation room of 1520 Sedgwick Avenue. Sources have noted that while 1520 Sedgwick Avenue was not the actual birthplace of hip hop – the genre developed slowly in several places in the 1970s – it was verified to be the place where one of the pivotal and formative events occurred that spurred hip hop culture forward. During a rally to save the building, DJ Kool Herc said, '1520 Sedgwick is the Bethlehem of Hip-Hop culture.'</p>

<p>The Village Vanguard is a jazz club that was opened on February 22, 1935 by Max Gordon. At first, it featured many forms of music, such as folk music and beat poetry, but it switched to an all-jazz format in 1957. This club has helped unknown musicians, such as Thelonious Monk, launch their careers.Well known musicians such as John Coltrane and Bill Evans were regulars and recorded many songs there as well. In 1989, Max Gordon died. The day after, Lorraine Gordon closed the Vanguard. But the following day, she reopened it and has continued to run the place ever since. She has not made any alterations of any kind, and kept it how it was, how people liked it.</p>
